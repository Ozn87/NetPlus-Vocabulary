# Comprehensive CompTIA Network+ Vocabulary List

This list provides definitions for common and advanced terms, acronyms, and concepts in IT networking, specifically geared towards individuals preparing for the CompTIA Network+ certification (N10-008 / N10-009).

## 1. General Networking Concepts

* **Network:** A group of two or more interconnected devices (like computers, printers, servers) that can exchange data and share resources.
* **Internet:** A global network of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.
* **Intranet:** A private network contained within an enterprise. It may consist of many interlinked local area networks and also use leased lines in the wide area network.
* **Extranet:** A controlled private network that allows access to partners, vendors, and suppliers or an authorized set of customers – normally to a subset of the information accessible from an organization's intranet.
* **Client:** A device or software application that requests services or resources from a server.
* **Server:** A computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
* **Node:** Any device connected to a network that can send, receive, or forward information. This includes computers, printers, routers, switches, etc.
* **Host:** Any device on a network that has an IP address. Often used interchangeably with "node," but typically refers to end devices like computers and servers.
* **Bandwidth:** The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. It's a measure of network capacity, often expressed in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (Kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps).
* **Latency:** The delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer. In networking, it's the time it takes for a data packet to travel from its source to its destination. Measured in milliseconds (ms).
* **Round Trip Time (RTT):** The time it takes for a signal to be sent plus the time it takes for an acknowledgment of that signal to be received.
* **Jitter:** Variation in the delay of received packets. Affects real-time applications like VoIP and video streaming.
* **Throughput:** The actual rate of data transfer that is achieved over a network, as opposed to the theoretical maximum (bandwidth).
* **Goodput:** The amount of usable data that crosses a given point in a network over a certain period of time, excluding overhead like retransmissions or protocol headers.
* **Packet/Datagram:** A small unit of data transmitted over a packet-switched network. Data is broken down into packets for more efficient transmission and reassembled at the destination.
* **Frame:** A Data Link layer (Layer 2) PDU (Protocol Data Unit) that encapsulates a Layer 3 packet.
* **Segment:** A Transport Layer (Layer 4) PDU, typically referring to TCP segments.
* **Encapsulation:** The process of adding control information (headers and sometimes trailers) to data as it passes down the OSI or TCP/IP model layers.
* **De-encapsulation (Decapsulation):** The process of removing headers and trailers as data moves up the OSI or TCP/IP model layers.
* **Data Collision:** A situation that occurs when two or more devices attempt to transmit data over a shared network medium (like old Ethernet hubs or half-duplex links) at the same time, resulting in corrupted data.
* **Collision Domain:** A section of a network where data packets can collide with one another when being sent on a shared medium. Switches break up collision domains.
* **Broadcast Domain:** A logical area of a computer network where any computer connected to the network can transmit directly to all other computers in the same domain without going through a router. Routers break up broadcast domains.
* **Broadcast:** A method of data transmission where a single message is sent from one point to all other nodes on a network segment or within a broadcast domain.
* **Unicast:** A method of data transmission from one point to another single point.
* **Multicast:** A method of data transmission from one point to a selected group of other points (subscribers) on a network. (e.g., IGMP)

## 10. Routing Concepts

* **Routing:** The process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic.
* **Router:** (See Network Hardware)
* **Routing Table:** A data table stored in a router or networked computer that lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases, metrics (distances) associated with those routes.
* **Route:** A path between a source and a destination on a network.
* **Metric (Routing Metric):** A value used by routing algorithms to determine the best path to a destination. Common metrics include hop count, bandwidth, delay, load, reliability, cost.
* **Administrative Distance (AD):** A value from 0 to 255 that indicates the trustworthiness of a routing information source. Lower values are preferred. Used when a router learns about the same destination from multiple routing protocols.
* **Next Hop:** The IP address of the next router that a packet must be sent to on its way to the destination.
* **Static Routing:** Routes are manually configured by a network administrator. Simple, secure, but not scalable or fault-tolerant.
* **Dynamic Routing:** Routers automatically learn routes from other routers using routing protocols. Scalable and adapts to network changes.
* **Routing Protocols:**
  * **Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP):** Used for routing within an Autonomous System (AS).
    * **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Distance-vector protocol, uses hop count as metric. Older, slower convergence, limited to 15 hops. (RIPv1 is classful, RIPv2 is classless).

  * **Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP):** Used for routing between different Autonomous Systems.
    * **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** Path-vector protocol, the core routing protocol of the internet. Uses path attributes (AS-Path, NEXT_HOP, etc.) to make complex routing decisions. AD: 20 (eBGP), 200 (iBGP).
* **Distance-Vector Protocol:** Routers advertise their routing tables to their direct neighbors. Prone to routing loops and slow convergence ("routing by rumor"). (e.g., RIP, IGRP - older Cisco).
* **Link-State Protocol:** Routers build a complete map (topology database) of the network by exchanging link-state advertisements (LSAs) with all other routers in the same area. Faster convergence, less prone to loops. (e.g., OSPF, IS-IS).
* **Path-Vector Protocol:** Routers advertise entire paths to destinations (sequences of AS numbers). Used by BGP to prevent loops in inter-AS routing.
* **Convergence:** The process by which all routers in a network agree on the current network topology and update their routing tables accordingly after a change.
* **Routing Loop:** A condition where packets are continuously routed between a set of routers without reaching their destination.
* **Split Horizon:** A distance-vector routing rule that prevents a router from advertising a route back onto the interface from which it was learned. Helps prevent routing loops.
* **Route Poisoning / Poison Reverse:** Techniques used by distance-vector protocols to mark a failed route as unreachable (e.g., with an infinite metric) and advertise it back to prevent other routers from using it.
* **Hold-down Timer:** After a route is marked as down, a router starts a hold-down timer. During this time, the router ignores any updates about that route that indicate it is better than the previously known state, preventing flapping routes.
* **Default Route (Gateway of Last Resort):** A route that is used when no specific route to a destination is found in the routing table (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0).
* **Floating Static Route:** A static route with a higher administrative distance than a dynamically learned route. It acts as a backup route if the primary (dynamic) route fails.
